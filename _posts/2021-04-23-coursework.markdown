My coursework has covered the fundamentals of computer science with an emphasis in data science and a minor in math. The courses I've taken include Data Structures, Algorithms, Machine Learning, Linear Algebra, and Artificial Intelligence. You can see most of my work on my [Github](https://github.com/kvarforl)! 

Some highlights:

- [Machine Learning](https://github.com/kvarforl/CS434_MachineLearning)
- [Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/kvarforl/CS331_ArtificialIntelligence)
- [Networks In Computational Biology](https://github.com/kvarforl/CS446_FinalProject)
- [Operating Systems 1](https://github.com/kvarforl/OS1)

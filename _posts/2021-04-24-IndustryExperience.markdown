I have past experience on a variety of projects in a professional research environment at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and HP Inc, and have held a developer role on projects through an organization at my university known as the Center for Applied Systems and Software (CASS). This summer, I'm headed to BioFire Diagnostics to work as a software developer!
